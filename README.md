# Research on principles of plotting
Sijal Dhakal's summer 2020 research internship
<hr>

In search for the principles of effective plotting, we studied hundreds of charts and plots in various news and research articles. During the process, we documented the plots and styles that we found were very effective. The first document [plot_types.pdf](./plot_types.pdf) summarizes the various types of plots we found. With the help of an example for each type, we discuss when such a plot type is effective. In the second document [example_plots.pdf](./example_plots.pdf) we have collected around 25 plots that serve as representative examples for us to study what characteristics make plots effective. Most of the plots we have collected here are examples of effective plots. Overall, we find that this is a relatively under explored area of research and study. Although this is a “in progress” project, these example plots we collected, we believe, will be useful for us and others.
